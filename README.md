# Match-making-google-form

Me and my team are trying to make a match-making Google form where we have two Google forms one for contractors and Construction Firms and the other for job seekers. we are using 
The Apple script is in the Google sheet. The Google sheet is the same one linked to the Google form surveys. We also have a trigger in apple script. 

What do we want the code to do?
1. when a contractor and a job seeker's questions are the same for one or more questions we want it to be considered a match.
2. When there is a match we want it to automatically put it into a Google sheet called matches where the construction Firm and the job seeker are put together in the sheet as a match
3. The criteria For them to be considered a match are Industry, Company size, What size project are you interstead in, Trade type , Employment Terms and if they selected yes to being connected to a potential match.
4. We also want to be emailed and notified when a match has been made through the forms.
